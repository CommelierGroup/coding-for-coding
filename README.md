# Coding for Coding: Web Development Showcase

Welcome to the Coding for Coding repository, a showcase for various web development techniques and practices without the constraints of real-world application requirements.

# What Techniques have been used?

## Unclassified

- [ ] Nest.js
- [ ] CloudFormation
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Web Push
- [ ] Serverless Architecture
- [ ] Containerization
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Microservices Architecture
- [ ] RESTful API
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] Continuous Integration
- [ ] Continuous Development
- [ ] RDBMS
- [ ] NoSQL
- [ ] Message Brokers
- [ ] Event-Driven Architecture
- [ ] Distributed Tracing: A method used to debug and monitor applications built using microservices architecture. Popular tools include Jaeger and Zipkin.
- [ ] ContentDelivery Network
- [ ] API Gateway
- [ ] Zero Downtime Deployments
- [ ] QA Automation
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Cloud-Native Application Development
- [ ] Load Balancing
- [ ] Elasticity and Scalability in the Cloud
- [ ] Data Replication and Sharding
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Monitoring
- [ ] Alerts
- [ ] Database Partitioning
- [ ] Real Time Streaming and Batch Processing
- [ ] Identity Provider
- [ ] Secrets Management

- [ ] Stateless Architecture
- [ ] Web Application Firewall
- [ ] Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer
- [ ] HTTP Response Status Codes
- [ ] API Versioning
- [ ] Error Tracking and Exception Handling
- [ ] Messge Queues and Asynchronous Processing
- [ ] Microservices Observability: Communication between microservices can sometimes be complex and difficult to monitor. Tools like Istio and Linkerd provide the ability to visualize, control, and secure thr traffic between services.
- [ ] Open Telemetry
- [ ] Feature Flagging: This development methodology can help make feature rollouts less risky and more steady. It enables developers to hid, enable or disable the feature in production, so they can safely test and release new features.
- [ ] Blud-Green Deployments
- [ ] Localization and Internationalization
- [ ] GraphQL Subscription
- [ ] CORS Configuration
- [ ] Rate Limiting and Throttling
- [ ] Unit Testing
- [ ] Integration Testing

- [ ] End-toEnd Encryption
- [ ] Domain-Driven Design
- [ ] JSON Web Token
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Filtering
- [ ] Environment-Specific Configuration
- [ ] Scheduled Jobs and Cron Tasks
- [ ] Memory Management and Leaks Detection
- [ ] Two-Factor Authentication
- [ ] Service Mesh: A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication, responsible for the reliable delivery of requests in a complex, networked system.
- [ ] Latency and Exception Monitoring
- [ ] API Design Principles
- [ ] gRPC
- [ ] Traffic Shadowing
- [ ] Health Checks and Self Healing System
- [ ] Test-Driven Development
- [ ] Circuit Breaker Design Pattern
- [ ] Event Sourcing: A technique that involves saving changes to application state as a sequence of events, which can be replayed to recreate the application state at any point in time.
- [ ] Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): This pattern separates read and update operations for a data store, optimizing for different needs of the two operations.
- [ ] IPV6 Transition
- [ ] WebRTC
- [ ] Distributed Caching
- [ ] HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- [ ] HTTP Caching Strategy
- [ ] Server-Sent Event (SSE)
- [ ] Docker Compose
- [ ] Elastic STack
- [ ] GraphQL Federation
- [ ] Mutation Testing
- [ ] Runtime Type Checking
- [ ] Security Headers
- [ ] Server Timing Metrics: Metrics to measure where server time is spent while loading the application.
- [ ] Service Discovery: Enables automatic detection of services offered by a system.
- [ ] tRPC
- [ ] Terraform
- [ ] k8s
- [ ] Firebase
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] Compiler
- [ ] Human Psychology
- [ ] Redis
- [ ] MemCached
- [ ] Apache Kafka
